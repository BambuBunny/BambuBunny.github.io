					<h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI), the study of the simulation of intelligent behaviors, has recently been researched more in depth and widely known in the 21st century. Although AI is only a recent field, the study of AI dates back to 1941 when the first computer was made by a German scientist Konrad Zuse. This first discovery of AI was used only for aerodynamic calculations and had a 22 bit word limit. From this discovery, incredible advances has been made including the ground breaking 1975 “Alto” computer with an user interface and advanced printing mechanism and has been continually refined to what most notably known today to the public in the form of Apple’s iPhones and Amazon’s Alexa. 		
					</h4>
					<h4>The term “Artificial intelligence” comes from John McCarthy in  a 1956 conference as the study of implementing humanesque behaviors, mind, and actions into technology. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, working at IBM, made the first “learning machine.” This machine was programmed to play checkers against high level players and improved it’s play style over past experiences. This revolutionized the creation of later AI using his method of an autonomic and self learning computer machine. Two studies in 1963 and 1964 by Evans and Bobrow displayed that machines could solve highly complex math problems and understand the human language. These ideas of AI were the core learning aspects behind the technology of it. The first major use of AI that humans couldn't do was shown by Nasa’s Pathfinder Mission in 1996 where Nasa’s Pathfinder was successfully launched and landed on the surface of Mars. In the early 2000s, the use of AIs in smart toys were first fully realized and sold to the public. This created the realization of using AI in everyday life for mass public consumption and sparked the interest of AI helping humans in tasks not able to be achieved by human activity.

						<h2>Technology Behind AI</h2>
					</div>
		
						<div class="col-md-6 animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInLeft" style="color:#000">

								<li>Natural Language Generation - Intelligent AI are able to convert data into text which allows  it to communicate easily and precisely. E.g. customer service to generate reports and market summaries.</li>
								<li>Speech Recognition - Systems are incorporating transformation of human language into feasible formats for use of computers. Speech recognition is currently being implanted into voice-interactive systems and mobile apps.</li>
								<li>Virtual Agents - virtual agents are capable of interacting with humans. Examples of virtual agents are chatbots.</li>
								<li>Machine Learning Platforms - With algorithms, AI can be subject to programs which allows them to gain experience over time.</li>
								<li>AI-optimized hardware - Graphic and processing units are designed to specifically execute aI-oriented tasks.</li>
								<li>Decision Management - the introduction of rules and logic to intelligent ai can allow for ai to make the smartest decision it deems fit which can save energy and time.</li>
								<li>Deep Learning Problems - programs that mimic the human brain into the robot which allows it for process data and recognize patterns which can help it in completing tasks.</li>
								<li>Biometrics - biometrics is identification of the human structure and behavior. This allows for natural interaction between ai and humans involving touch, speech, and body-language recognition.</li>
								<li>Robotic Processes Automation - It is designed to automate human tasks and support processes. It allows the ai to perform tasks in which humans are unable to do.</li>
								<li>Text Analytics and NLP (Natural Language Processing) - It understands the structure of sentences which lets it interpret meaning and intention. E.g. security systems and fraud detection.</li>

						<li>Smart cars. Due to the help of AI’s, people can soon drive to a place without the effort required. The technology of smart cars is in development and can be used in the public for as early as the next decade. It is also very crucial as it can detect barriers to avoid crashes and take the quickest and most efficient route to the required destination. This can be crucial in the modern day world as it can solve the problem of vehicle crashes and injuries.</li>
						<li>AI in education- can automate grading, giving educators more time. AI can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace.</li>

							<li>Using the location data of smartphones, Google maps can accurately predict the level of traffic from accidents and construction in real time to users. It then uses an algorithm to determine the fastest passage to and from your destination.</li>
							<li>AI autopilots being programmed today, are some of the earliest uses of AI technology being used today, AI uses in commercial aircraft allows an average of only 7 minutes of human-steered flight.</li>
							<li>Ability to display useful information using only voice (Siri, Alexa)- find simple solutions to commonly asked questions without the time needed to manually search it.</li>
							<li>AI in business- Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers (Disney’s big data in its Magicband). Chatbots have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers. (better customer services)</li>
