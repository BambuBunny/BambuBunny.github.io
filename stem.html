The Seminole High Science NHS is organized into 8 distinct scientific committees which are as follows: chemistry, biology, computer science, physics, psychology, environmental science, health science, and STEMpowerment. Science NHS members have numerous opportunities to explore their scientific endeavors through these committee workshops held throughout the year. Members can learn to program a mobile app, conduct a forensics lab, practice how to do hands-only CPR, and be apart of a short term memory loss experiment. Science NHS embraces all there is to offer in the field of science. To uphold good standing within the chapter, all members are required to document and submit to the secretaries: 90 minutes of science tutoring, 4 hours of science experience, and 10 hours of community service.</p>
